# Module 4 Challenge - School District Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to remove the suspicious reading and math scores from Grade 9 at Thomas High School and prepare an analysis that describes how the metrics changed when these scores were removed. The analysis will focus on the following questions:
- How is the district summary affected?
- How is the school summary affected?
- How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance relative to the other schools?
- Math and reading scores by grade
- Scores by school spending 
- Scores by school size 
- Scores by school type 


## School District Analysis Results
- The school district summary shows that the scoring metrics for Charter Schools all decrease as the  averages from Thomas High School also decreased
- Thomas High School is still the second highest-performing school relative to other schools, but the scoring metrics are reduced.
- Math and reading scores by grade are now lower for grade nine in Thomas High School
- The scores by school spending are relatively the same, with a trend of the low and medium spending schools achieving higher scores across the scoring metrics (https://github.com/pmoores/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/School_spending.png)
